"Westchester’s top-notch schools, highly educated workforce, great quality of life, accessibility to transportation and proximity to New York City make it a great location for businesses, particularly those in the technology and biotech industries," said Leonard S. Schleifer, founder, president and CEO of  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. “Westchester has everything you need for a high-tech company.” During the roughly 45-minute conversation – led by Business Council President and CEO Marsha Gordon – Schleifer spoke of his company’s origins, which started in a New York City apartment. He also discussed the company’s patient-centered and science-driven philosophy and reasons why Regeneron is expanding in New York and investing millions in its Tarrytown-based campus. Schleifer also spoke about the importance of STEM education, global competitiveness and his work with the Mid-Hudson Regional Economic Development Council, of which Gordon is also a member.




“We couldn’t have had a better evening to kick off this exciting series and we couldn’t have had a more interesting guest,” Gordon said of Schleifer. “We look forward to hosting more conversations that clearly show Westchester is home to some of the best and brightest workers and companies in the world.” As part of the event, the Business Council also presented its Westchester Business Champion Awards to MasterCard, Mindspark and Montefiore Medical Center. The awards are presented quarterly to businesses that have relocated, recommitted, expanded or started in Westchester County.

Accepting the awards were Patrick Dwyer, vice president of MasterCard; Jeff Paradise, senior vice president of Digital Marketing of Mindspark and Dr. Phil Ozuah, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Montefiore Health System.
