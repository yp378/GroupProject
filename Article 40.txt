Regeneron Likely To Outperform In 2019
Jan. 18, 2019 5:14 PM ETRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN)15 Comments
Summary
Regeneron is a biotech company with revenue earning drugs and a decent pipeline.
Regeneron has performed poorly for years but is also very volatile, and 2018 proved a successful year for their primary drug, Eylea, which likely earned over $4 billion in 2018.
Regeneron will likely have a second drug that will earn over $1 billion in 2019: Dupixent. Both Dupixent and Eylea also have possible further indication approvals coming this Spring.
Regeneron's earnings report next month should be strong.
Regeneron may have just reversed a long-term downturn and is ready to break out.
Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) is a biotechnology company with a focus on helping patients with eye diseases, allergic & inflammatory conditions, cancer, and neuromuscular diseases. The company will report earnings on February 6, 2019, and I believe a strong report and possible Spring approvals will push Regeneron shares up significantly.

Regeneron performed well in 2018
In 2018, Regeneron saw continued strong growth for Eylea (aflibercept) for retinal diseases and Dupixent (dupilumab) for atopic dermatitis. The company also launched Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and expanded Dupixent to include treatment of asthma. Regeneron also has more than 20 investigational candidates currently within human clinical trials and is likely to add a few in 2018.

Regeneron's primary money maker is Eylea, which earned $4.07 billion in 2018 U.S. net sales, based on preliminary, unaudited fourth quarter 2018 U.S. net sales of $1.07 billion (as provided by Regeneron's update at the 2019 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference). Eylea is also up for another indication in diabetic retinopathy, and the FDA assigned an action date of May 13, 2019, for it.

Regeneron also noted that Dupixent continues to accelerate in both atopic dermatitis and the 2018 asthma launch. The drug has an FDA action date of March 11, 2019, for expansion of atopic dermatitis to adolescents between 12 and 17, and it is expected that Regeneron will file with the FDA for approval to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Regeneron also has numerous studies for further indications, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, as well as grass and peanut allergies, and Regeneron began clinical studies of Dupixent in combination with other experimental drugs.
