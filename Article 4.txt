Former Wall Street analyst joins firm at pivotal time

US biotechnology firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has appointed Michael Aberman as vice president of strategy and investor relations. Peter Dworkin, vice president, will continue to be responsible for corporate communications.

Prior to joining Regeneron, Aberman spent six years as a Wall Street research analyst covering the biotechnology industry. Most recently, he was director and senior biotechnology analyst at Credit Suisse and before that, vice president and biotech analyst at Morgan Stanley. Before moving to Wall Street, Aberman was director of business development at Antigenics, an oncology-focused biotechnology company.

‘I am very excited to be joining Regeneron at a pivotal time in its history,’ said Aberman. ‘2010 will bring results from multiple Phase III trials in gout, age-related macular degeneration, and cancer. In addition, the expanded collaboration with Sanofi-Aventis positions Regeneron to capitalise on its capabilities to build a robust pipeline of antibody-based product candidates over the coming years.’
