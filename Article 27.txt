In a bit of unexpected drama, the heads of several big drug makers were openly lambasted over pricing, but this time, the criticism was leveled by one of their own – Dr. Leonard Schleifer, who runs Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. And the exchange that ensued underscores the challenges the pharmaceutical industry faces in coming to grips with a problem that is unlikely to go away anytime soon.

While speaking at a conference on Thursday, Schleifer said the industry “dispelled” some of the criticism last year by blaming it on “evil doers.” This was a reference to Martin Shkreli, who ran Turing Pharmaceuticals at the time, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, both of which bought older medicines and then quickly jacked up the prices to sky-high levels. But drug makers should look in the mirror, he argued.

“The real reason we’re not liked, in my opinion, is because, we as an industry, have used price hikes to cover up the gaps in innovation. I may be kicked off the all-star team for saying this, but look at how prices have gone up by double digits, sometimes twice a year,” he said at the Forbes Healthcare Summit, where he was on a panel with other pharma executives to discuss the industry’s battered reputation.
