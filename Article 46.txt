Nov 4 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue on strong demand for its COVID-19 antibody cocktail during the Delta variant-led surge in infections in the United States.

U.S. sales of the cocktail, REGEN-COV, approved for emergency use in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, were $676.7 million in the third quarter, compared with analysts' estimates of $320.5 million.

A sharp surge in COVID-19 cases led by the Delta variant caused a "tremendous acceleration" in use of the cocktail, Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Leonard Schleifer had said in August.

Regeneron delivered 300,000 doses of the 1.4 million additional doses that were ordered by the U.S. government in September for $2.94 billion. The company will supply the rest by Jan. 31. read more
