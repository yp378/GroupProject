Regeneron Priced Right For Long-Term Investors

Summary
Regeneron is well off its 52-week high.
Sales remain strong, and the pipeline is promising.
Now is a good time to accumulate the stock.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) is a profitable biotech pharmaceutical company best known for Eylea, used mainly to treat wet macular degeneration of the eye. While over half its revenue still comes from Eylea, it has another clear winner in Dupixent, plus a pipeline of therapy candidates that should bring value in the future. After years of being, in my opinion, steeply priced, Regeneron is now priced right for accumulating.

Price is most attractive in 5 years
ChartData by YCharts
As visible in the above chart, Regeneron went above $550 per share years ago as investors saw the potential for increased Eylea sales. Some of the excitement was also about the potential for Praluent sales, which, like its PCSK9, cholesterol medicine competition, failed to meet expectations when insurers objected to its high cost. I believe the current price mainly reflects investor sentiment weakening, not long-term potential. The 52-week high is $442, while the 52-week low is $271.57.

Q2 results were strong
Q2 2019 Regeneron revenue was $1.93 billion, up 13% sequentially from $1.71 billion and up 20% from $1.61 billion in the year-earlier quarter.

GAAP diluted EPS (Earnings Per Share) was $1.68, down 58% sequentially from $3.99 and down 65% from $4.82 year-earlier. But on a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $6.02, up 35% sequentially from $4.45 and up 10% from $5.45 year-earlier. A $400 million upfront payment on a license and collaboration agreement that was expensed was excluded from non-GAAP results, as was share based compensation expense of $59 million, loss on an equity investment of $131 million, and other items.
